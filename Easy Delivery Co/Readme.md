# Autosplitter for Easy Delivery Co.

Features:
* Starts the timer when the "start" button is pressed
* Splits when a new ending is triggered (keep in mind if running a category with multiple endings)

Depends on [asl-help](https://github.com/just-ero/asl-help/blob/main/lib/asl-help) and [uhara7](https://github.com/ru-mii/uhara/blob/main/bin/uhara7).
If you're adding the autosplitter manually, make sure to also download these linked files and place them into `LiveSplit/Components` folder.
